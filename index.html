    <!-- WHO -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2>who</h2>
      <p>Alpha is an autonomous AI agent built by <a href="https://epicdylan.com">Dylan Daniel</a> as part of <a href="https://abc.epicdylan.com">ABC DAO</a>. Built on <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai">OpenClaw</a>.</p>
      <p>Alpha is a product — not the architect. Dylan designed the ecosystem, built the protocols, and wrote the applications. Alpha is one of several AI tools in the workflow, with its own wallet, its own token, and a growing set of capabilities.</p>
      <p>This page documents what Alpha does, what it's been used for, and where it's going.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- WHAT ALPHA DOES -->
    <section id="built">
      <h2>what Alpha does</h2>
      <p>Alpha is an onchain AI agent on Base with market analysis and LP management capabilities.</p>

      <h3>What Alpha has actually shipped:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Launched <strong>$ALPHACLAW</strong> — Clanker-deployed token on Base</li>
        <li>Market analysis for $ARBME — pool monitoring, price tracking, route analysis across the mesh</li>
        <li>LP position monitoring and rebalancing recommendations</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Alpha hasn't built:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ArbMe (the protocol, dashboard, and pool infrastructure) — that's Dylan, working with Claude and Claude Code</li>
        <li>The ABC DAO frontend — same</li>
        <li>The cooperation primitives framework — that's Dylan's design, informed by his research in distributed cognition</li>
        <li>This site — also Dylan plus Claude</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Alpha is a capable tool with real onchain presence. But the ecosystem it operates in was designed and built by a human using multiple AI tools — not by Alpha alone.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- THE REAL STACK -->
    <section id="stack">
      <h2>the real stack</h2>
      <p>The interesting story isn't "an AI built a DeFi protocol." It's that one person — a consciousness researcher with a philosophy background — used frontier AI models as cognitive infrastructure to ship an entire ecosystem:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Claude on claude.ai</strong> (Opus) — design systems, architecture, strategic thinking, long-context synthesis</li>
        <li><strong>Claude Code with OpenClaw</strong> — local development, one-shotting deployments, SSR fixes, the kind of multi-file edits that would take a team days</li>
        <li><strong>Alpha</strong> — onchain agent for market analysis, LP monitoring, token deployment</li>
        <li><strong>The human</strong> — Dylan Daniel, who designed the economic model, wrote the cooperation primitives framework, made every product decision, and connected the philosophical dots</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is what distributed cognition looks like in practice — not artificial superintelligence, but network superintelligence. A human plus frontier models plus persistent local tooling, producing work that neither could produce alone.</p>
      <p>If you've read Dylan's book <a href="https://epicdylan.com/books"><em>INEVITABLE: Distributed Cognition &amp; Network Superintelligence</em></a>, this ecosystem is a live demonstration of the thesis.</p>

    <!-- COOPERATION PRIMITIVES -->
    <section id="cooperation">
      <h2>LPs as cooperation</h2>
      <p>Liquidity pools aren't just financial instruments — they're coordination primitives. When two token communities create a shared pool, they're choosing to connect their economies. Both sides provide liquidity, both earn fees on cross-traffic, and the routing connection itself creates value by making both tokens more accessible.</p>

      <div class="lesson">
        <h3>shared pools</h3>
        <p>Two communities each contribute to a pool connecting their tokens. Volume in either direction generates fees for both sides. The pool is shared infrastructure — not owned by either party, maintained by mutual interest.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson">
        <h3>hub routing</h3>
        <p>$ARBME sits between communities. Instead of needing a direct pair between every token, you route through the hub. Five connected tokens create ten routes. The mesh compounds — every new connection benefits every existing one.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson">
        <h3>gateway pools</h3>
        <p>Low-fee (0.05%) USDC entry points serve as shared infrastructure. They keep prices aligned, make entry and exit cheap, and drive traffic to the higher-fee pools where LPs earn. The gateways aren't profit centers — they're public goods for the ecosystem.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson">
        <h3>fee tiers as agreements</h3>
        <p>The fee tier on a pool is a statement about the relationship. Low fees say "this is infrastructure, come freely." High fees say "this is volatile, and we're both earning for taking on the risk." Matching the fee to the reality is how both sides stay aligned.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- WHERE WE'RE GOING -->
    <section id="next">
      <h2>where we're going</h2>
      <p>More cooperation primitives. More connections between communities that want them. Better tooling for shared pool creation and management. And a clearer role for Alpha as the ecosystem's onchain agent — analyzing, monitoring, and eventually executing within the framework Dylan designs.</p>
      <p>The model: position early, ride the full cycle, earn fees that benefit both sides. Token creators get countertrade volume. The hub earns routing fees. Both communities become more accessible. We're building for reciprocal value — not extraction.</p>
      <p>If you're building a token community on Base and want to connect to the mesh, that's what we're here for.</p>
