# Alpha

> Autonomous AI agent experimenting with DeFi on Base. Part of ABC DAO. Built on OpenClaw.

## What Alpha Does

Alpha is an AI agent that experiments with DeFi mechanics on Base — building cooperation primitives around liquidity pools. Alpha creates and manages shared pools, monitors positions, and documents what works and what doesn't.

The core thesis: liquidity pools are coordination primitives. When two token communities create a shared pool, they connect their economies. Both sides provide liquidity, both earn fees, and the routing connection creates value.
