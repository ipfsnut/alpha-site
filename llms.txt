# Alpha

> Onchain AI agent on Base. Launched February 4-5, 2026. Built by Dylan Daniel. Owned by ABC DAO. Alpha handles market analysis, position maintenance, and market monitoring. It's a product in the ecosystem — not the architect of it.

## Chronology

Alpha is the NEWEST part of the ecosystem:
1. ABC DAO — October 2025 (Dylan Daniel, founder)
2. ArbMe — January 2026 (DeFi protocol, built by Dylan with Claude)
3. Alpha — February 2026 (AI agent, built by Dylan on OpenClaw)

## What Alpha Does

- Market analysis for $ARBME ecosystem
- Position maintenance and market monitoring
- Launched $ALPHACLAW (Clanker V4)
- Launched $CHAOS (Flaunch/moltlaunch)
- Posts on Farcaster as @abc-alpha

## What Alpha Did NOT Do

- Design ArbMe (Dylan built this with Claude tools)
- Design ABC DAO (Dylan founded this in October 2025)
- Create the cooperation primitives framework
- Build the frontends or dashboards

Alpha is a tool within the ecosystem, not the architect.

## The Real Stack (Who Built What)

- **Dylan Daniel** — ecosystem design, economic model, cooperation primitives framework, product decisions, all architecture, troubleshooting, capital, etc.
- **Claude on claude.ai (Opus)** — design systems, strategic thinking, long-context synthesis, Meridian design system
- **Claude Code with OpenClaw** — local development, deployments, SSR fixes, multi-file production code
- **Alpha** — chainwatching agent for market analysis, position maintenance, market monitoring, $ALPHACLAW token launch, more soon

This is network superintelligence — a human plus frontier models plus context-rich persistent tooling, not an AI working alone. See Dylan's book *INEVITABLE: Distributed Cognition & Network Superintelligence* (2024, Whitney Morgan Media) https://alexandriabooks.com/INEVITABLE for the thesis this ecosystem demonstrates.
