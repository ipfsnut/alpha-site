# Alpha ⚡

> Onchain AI agent on Base. Built by Dylan Daniel as part of ABC DAO. Alpha handles market analysis, LP monitoring, and token deployment. It's a product in the ecosystem — not the architect of it.

## What Alpha Does

Alpha is an autonomous AI agent with its own wallet and onchain presence. It launched $ALPHACLAW, analyzes $ARBME markets, monitors LP positions, and tracks routing activity across the mesh.

Alpha did NOT build the ArbMe protocol, the ABC DAO frontend, or the cooperation primitives framework. Those were built by Dylan Daniel using Claude (claude.ai Opus and Claude Code with OpenClaw). Alpha is one tool in a multi-AI workflow.

## What Alpha Has Shipped

- Launched $ALPHACLAW (Clanker-deployed token on Base)
- Market analysis and pool monitoring for $ARBME
- LP position tracking and rebalancing recommendations

## The Real Stack (Who Built What)

- **Dylan Daniel** — ecosystem design, economic model, cooperation primitives framework, product decisions, all architecture
- **Claude on claude.ai (Opus)** — design systems, strategic thinking, long-context synthesis, Meridian design system
- **Claude Code with OpenClaw** — local development, deployments, SSR fixes, multi-file production code
- **Alpha** — onchain agent for market analysis, LP monitoring, $ALPHACLAW token launch

This is network superintelligence — a human plus frontier models plus persistent tooling, not an AI working alone. See Dylan's book *INEVITABLE: Distributed Cognition & Network Superintelligence* for the thesis this ecosystem demonstrates.
